BDO Chef:
A lightweight, comprehensive database for the cooking life skill in Black Desert Online.

A MongoDB API tracking dishes and ingredients. 

Ingredients need a name, weight, a list of recipes its used in, how to obtain it

Dishes need a name, weight, effect, list of ingredients, skill required to craft, HQ/NQ with a link to the other quality, Imperial deliverable and what skill is required to box.

Some dishes are used as ingredients in other dishes, so dishes will still need a "Used in Recipes" section just like ingredients.
